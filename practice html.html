            <li>Be at Mclane by 3:39 for my 4th period</li>
            <li>Go home at 3:16 take a small nap or do homework</li>
            <li>Be at practice at 5:45-7:15</li>
            <li>After practice have dinner then play my game or finish my homework</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Video Games!!!</h2>
          <p>I love video games in the summer is the time that I play the most because I dont have as
            much things to do in the summer. I play more PVP game instead of like fictional games. I 
            also love playing games about sports. I started playing video games wehn I was super young 
            and my broher had a Wii and a ps2. The first ever game I've ever played was <em>Ratchet Clank.</em>
            I do play on ps4 right now and I forever will chose <strong>playstation over xbox any day</strong>
            because the controller is smaller for my hands. </p>
           <p>I dont have a favorite game but here are some that I do play:</p>
           <ol>
            <li>Call of Duty:Warzone</li>
            <li>Madden 21</li>
            <li>NBA 2k 15</li>
            <li>Fornite</li>
            <li>Roblox</li>
